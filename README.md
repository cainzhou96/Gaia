# Gaia
A 2 vs 2 multiple player game. For each team, one player controls the terrain and the other player controls the ball. Terrain editor can modify the terrain to help the teammate to get points or block the opponent from getting points. The team with the highest points wins under a time limit.

Current project only works on Windows system. Run solution file in windows_server folder and solution file in windows_client folder to start the game. The rest players can be connected using telnet. 

To run the project in Mac platform, some new dependencies need to be installed in server side but the overall source file should be the same and should be able to compile and run as well. Mac version doesn't have stack terrain functionality due to the limitation of SDL library.
